This is a side project of unicorn company analysis, where the dataset is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/unicorn-companies-dataset). 

I focused on the analysis of development trend of unicorns over years, including which country and which industry have witnessed a rising number of unicorns in the recent decade.

Technique used: After basic data cleaning and wrangling, Plotly / Dash is used to do the data viz work.
